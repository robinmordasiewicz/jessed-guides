Terraform Essentials
============================

.. topic:: This is abridged and condensed core `Terraform <https://www.terraform.io/intro>`_, concepts.

   When first starting out most of the examples I found (by which I mean: every single one), seemed to assume that you understand the basic operation of Terraform and focused on the more complex use-cases. The problem with that is that I held certain misconceptions that none of those guides actually addressed. The most significant one was "How do I download the package (provider) to interact with a specific service?". The answer is "You don't", but all of the guides I found seemed to assume that knowledge and didn't address the topic. In hindsight I understand why, but it's been over two years and I still remember the intense frustration of that first day working with Terraform (TF). This guide is intended to answer those very basic beginner questions, as well as walk you through the creation of your first (extremely) simple Terraform Run so you can see how the various pieces for together.
